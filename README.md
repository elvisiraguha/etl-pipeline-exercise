Requirements

Build a small ETL pipeline in Python that:

extracts data from the WHO GHO OData API,

transforms the data in any reasonable way,

and loads it into a PostgreSQL database.


Extraction
Use the WHO GHO OData API to extract data on a health-related topic of your choice (e.g., life expectancy, disease prevalence, etc.). You can find the API documentation here: https://www.who.int/data/gho/info/gho-odata-api.
